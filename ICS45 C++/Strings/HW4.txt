Part 3.

Give an estimate of the relative efficiency of each of the following two assignments (I mean how many function calls, how many copies are made, etc): 
String s("Hello");
String t("There");
s = s + t;
s += t;


s calls the constructor once and stringToList as well as makes as many nodes necessary. It returns a copy to the constructor.
t does the same.

s = s + t; 

s + t calls copy as well as concat, makes a copy of the concatenated string and assigns it to s.

s+= t does the same except it doesn't make another copy, it concatenates it to s memory location.
